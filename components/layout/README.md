### Visual model

[![box model](https://i.imgur.com/js1BDYa.png)](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS22/box.html#content-width)

- `box-sizing` changes which area `width`, `max/min-width`, `height`, `max/min-height` points to
  - `content-box` -> content area
  - `border-box` -> border area
- HTML elements establish outer display (block/inline box) which defines how element's participation in [Normal Flow](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS22/visuren.html#normal-flow) and inner display which defines formating context for its content.

#### Block

Block-level elements generate block-level principal box (contains descendant boxes and generated content) which participate in block formatting context. In block formatting context, boxes are laid out one after others vertically, beginning at the top of [a containing block](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS22/visudet.html#containing-block-details).

Everything when rendering has to be in a box, in the example above there is no HTML element attached to, therefore, anonymous box is created. The properties of anonymous boxes are inherited from enclosing non-anonymous box (in example below is div), non-inherited properties have their initial value.

```html
<div>
  I am wrapped in an anonymous box
  <p>I am in the paragraph</p>
  I am wrapped in an anonymous box.
</div>
```

Anonymous box is also ignored when resolving percentage values, for example child of anonymous block box, which inside div, need to know its containing block height to resolve a percentage height, then it will use the height of div instead.

#### Inline

Inline-level elements generate inline-level boxes which participate in an inline formating context. In inline formating context, boxes are laid out horizontally one after other, beginning at the top of a containning block.

In example below, p generates a block box, two anonymous boxes (for "Hello" and "my old friend") and another inline box is generated by `em`.

```html
<p>Hello <em>darkness</em>, my old friend</p>
```
